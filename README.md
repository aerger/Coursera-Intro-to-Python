Coursera-Intro-to-Python
========================

Projects I've done as part of the course at: https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython

There's no Week 1 project here, as it was simply a one-liner along the lines of "print 'Hello World'", and entirely optional with no points awarded either way.
 
Most of these I bang out over a few hours in an evening; there may well be errors, but it's an intro course, so hey. :P

I'll also add that the course is pretty good as an intro course to Python, so if you're looking, I'd say I recommend it. Subject to change, and YMMV, of course.
