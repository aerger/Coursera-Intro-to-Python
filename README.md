Coursera-Intro-to-Python
========================

Projects I've done as part of the course taken at: https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython

There's no Week 1 project here, as it was simply a one-liner along the lines of "print 'Hello World'", and entirely optional with no points awarded either way.
